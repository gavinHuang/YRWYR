I need to build a chrome plugin that uses chrome browser history (chrome://history/) as data source.
the goal is to build a calendar to view what topic/theme was historical reading about.
the topic/theme should be able to show on the calendar with color code to dfferentiate with each other.
before write the code, please make a plan for me, listing steps and potential limitation
